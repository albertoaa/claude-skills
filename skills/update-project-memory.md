# Update Project Memory

## What to maintain

- .claude/skills/PROJECT-STATE.md

## On every update

1. Read the current PROJECT-STATE.md
2. Diff what changed against what is documented
3. Update ONLY the sections that changed:
   - Components: name, path, client/server, purpose (one line)
   - Routes: path, page component, layout
   - API endpoints: path, method, what it does
   - Dependencies: package, why it is here, version
   - Design tokens: new/removed tokens in Tailwind config
   - Conventions: any pattern that changed
4. Timestamp the update
5. Do NOT rewrite sections that did not change
6. Keep each entry to one line. This is an index, not documentation
